# Melon-Puzzle-Sudoku
Variation of Sudoku. Place integers from -4 to 4 into each cell so that each row, column, and region contains each integer from -4 to 4 exactly once. The numbers outside the grid represent the sum of all integers between that clue and the zero in that row/column. Some cells inside the grid already contain an integer but no sign is given. It is part of the puzzle to determine if these values are positive or negative.

An example using -2 to 2 from the WPC instructions is here.
